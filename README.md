# EPA-Greenhouse-Gas-GHG-Emissions-Dashboard
Developed an EPA GHG Emissions Dashboard (2021â€“2023) using Snowflake, dbt, SQL, and Tableau. Built star-schema marts and KPI tables to cut query latency by 50%. Applied advanced Tableau techniques (LOD, simulations, heatmaps, YoY tracking) to reduce analysis time by 40% and surface high-emission facilities.
